# gesture-volume-control
Python code that modifies device volume levels using hand gestures.

This is the initial version of the code.

Before running the script, make sure to install the required modules:
opencv-python
mediapipe

To install these in windows:
1. open command prompt (can run it with administrator as well)
2. run:
   pip install opencv-python
3. run:
   pip install mediapipe

As a pre-requisite, python should be already installed on the system.

The source code lies in 2 files, both written in Python, VolumeControl.py and handModule.py.

To run the application keep both files in the same directory and then execute VolumeControl.py.

Some instances from the application runtime are shown as below.

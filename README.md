# gesture-volume-control
Python code that modifies device volume levels using hand gestures.

This is the initial version of the code.

Before running the script, make sure to install the required modules:
opencv-python
mediapipe

To install these in windows:
1. open command prompt (can run it with administrator as well)
2. run:
   pip install opencv-python
3. run:
   pip install mediapipe

As a pre-requisite, python should be already installed on the system.
